# Overview

CryptoBot is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your
liking, making it completely customizable to suit your needs. 

This is a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need to host and maintain your own instance.  

# Plugins(Cogs)

CryptoBot is fully modular, allowing you to load and unload cogs of your choice. A few examples are:

- Caesar Cipher
- Vigenere Cipher

# Join the community!

**CryptoBot** is being continually developed, and it’s supported by an active community which produces new
content (cogs/plugins) for everyone to enjoy. New features are constantly added. If you can’t
find the cog you’re looking for, why not make your own?
